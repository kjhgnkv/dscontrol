So, if you want to build and use the plugin, you have to set cmake variables:

  - QTC_SOURCE - have to have inside src directory with other plugin code (for
  example - coreplugin)

  - QTC_BUILD - where running qmake

  - QTC_USER_DIR - directory, where will be your plugin. For example on linux: "~/.local/share/data/QtProject/qtcreator/plugins/4.8"
  on windows "%LOCALAPPDATA%\QtProject\QtCreator\plugins\4.8"

NOTE you need install clang-6.0 and libclang-6.0-dev

ON Linux
Better copy folder src in qt directory beside bin, and copy qtcreatordata.pri and qtcreator.pri dosc.pri
After it you just set QTC_BUILD and QTC_SOURCE to one directory (for example /opt/qt512)

ON Windows
for build on Windows you need read README.md on github.com/qt-creator/qt-creator

1) install perl
2) install llvm (manually, read in doc)

After build you need set environment to libraries, which was build (plugin libraries).
It will be on bin directory and lib/qtcreator/ (all directories with dll). Also you
need set path to llvm

WARNING!!! On Windows you also need set to environment directory with compiled
plugin (AppData/Local/...)


Need libDS.so near plugin, and build.

Command example:
qmake -r "QTC_BUILD = /home/dancon/Public/qt-creator/build" "QTC_SOURCE = /home/dancon/Public/qt-creator/" "DS_LIB = /home/dancon/Platformv2.0/DSControll/build/lib/libDS.so" ..

qmake -r "QTC_BUILD = /home/soft/Desktop/4_12/build" "QTC_SOURCE = /home/soft/Desktop/4_12/" "DS_LIB = /home/soft/Qt/Projects/Platformv2.0/DSControll/build/lib/libDS.so" "QTC_USER_DIR = ~/.local/share/data/QtProject/qtcreator/plugins/4.12.1"

cmake -D QTC_BUILD="/home/soft/Desktop/4_12" -D QTC_SOURCE="/home/soft/Desktop/4_12" -D DS_LIB="/home/soft/Qt/Projects/Platformv2.0/DSControll/build/lib/libDS.so" -D QTC_USER_DIR="~/.local/share/data/QtProject/qtcreator/plugins/4.12.1" ..



qmake -r /home/soft/Qt/Projects/Platformv2.0/DSControll/qt_plugin "QTC_BUILD = /home/soft/Desktop/4_12" "QTC_SOURCE = /home/soft/Desktop/4_12" "DS_LIB = /home/soft/Qt/Projects/Platformv2.0/DSControll/build/lib/libDS.so"

cmake .. -DQTC_BUILD=/home/soft/Desktop/4_12 -DQTC_SOURCE=/home/soft/Desktop/4_12 -DDS_LIB=/home/soft/Qt/Projects/Platformv2.0/DSControll/build/lib/libDS.so -DQTC_USER_DIR=/home/soft/.local/share/data/QtProject/qtcreator/plugins/4.12.1
